# Scaleway Block Volume CSI driver

> [!CAUTION]
> ⚠️ **Please read this first before doing anything else!** ⚠️

> You are currently on a branch which corresponds to the `v0.3` release of the Scaleway CSI.
>
> This release is **NOT** compatible with the `v0.2` and `v0.1` releases as it introduces

> snapshots.
>
> If you are currently using the `v0.2.x` or `v0.1.x` versions of the Scaleway CSI:

The [Scaleway Block Volume](https://www.scaleway.com/en/block-storage/)
Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver is an implementation of the
[CSI interface](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md)
to provide a way to manage Scaleway Block Volumes through a container orchestration system, like Kubernetes.

## CSI Specification Compatibility Matrix

| Scaleway CSI Driver \ CSI Version | v1.2.0 | v1.6.0 | v1.8.0 |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| master branch                     | ✅      | ✅      | ✅      |
| v0.1.x                            | ✅      | ❌      | ❌      |
| v0.2.x                            | ✅      | ✅      | ❌      |
| v0.3.x                            | ✅      | ✅      | ✅      |

## Scaleway Storage API Compatibility Matrix

Scaleway currently offers two APIs to manage Block Volumes and Snapshots:

- [Instance API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/)
- [Scaleway Block Storage API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/)

A Block Volume or Snapshot currently managed by the *Instance API* **cannot** be managed by the
*Scaleway Block Storage API* and vice versa.

In the future, all Block Volumes and Snapshots will be managed by the *Scaleway Block Storage API*.

In order to use newer versions of the CSI (v0.3+), it is needed to migrate Block Volumes and Snapshots
from the *Instance API* to the *Scaleway Block Storage API* using the [sbs-migration](./cmd/sbs-migration/) tool.
Your volumes will automatically be migrated if you use the Helm Chart.

## Features

Here is a list of features implemented by the Scaleway CSI driver.

### Block device resizing

The Scaleway CSI driver implements the resize feature ([example for Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/12/resizing-persistent-volumes-using-kubernetes/)).
It allows an online resize (without the need to detach the block device).
However resizing can only be done upwards, decreasing a volume's size is not supported.

### Raw Block Volume

[Raw Block Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/03/07/raw-block-volume-support-to-beta/)
allows the block volume to be exposed directly to the container as a block device,
instead of a mounted filesystem. To enable it, the `volumeMode` needs to be set to `Block`.
For instance, here is a PVC in raw block volume mode:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-raw-pvc
spec:
  volumeMode: Block
  [...]
```

### At-Rest Encryption

Support for volume encryption with Cryptsetup/LUKS. [See more details in examples](./examples/kubernetes#encrypting-volumes)

### Volume Snapshots

[Volume Snapshots](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/)
allows the user to create a snapshot of a specific block volume.

### Volume Statistics

The Scaleway CSI driver implements the [`NodeGetVolumeStats`](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md#nodegetvolumestats)
CSI method. It is used to gather statistics about the used block volumes. In Kubernetes,
`kubelet` exposes these metrics.

### Block Storage Low Latency

The Scaleway CSI driver is built upon the Block Storage Low Latency Scaleway product.
It currently provides volumes with up to 15,000 IOPS. By default, created volumes
have 5000 IOPS. To create volumes with higher IOPS, you can set the `iops` parameter
to the requested number of IOPS in your `StorageClass`. For example:

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: my-15k-iops-storage-class
provisioner: csi.scaleway.com
reclaimPolicy: Delete
parameters:
  iops: "15000"
```

## Kubernetes

This section is Kubernetes specific. Note that Scaleway CSI driver may work for
older Kubernetes versions than those announced. The CSI driver allows to use
[Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)
in Kubernetes.

### Kubernetes Version Compatibility Matrix

| Scaleway CSI Driver \ Kubernetes Version | Min K8s Version | Max K8s Version |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| master branch                            | v1.20           | -               |
| v0.1.x                                   | v1.17           | -               |
| v0.2.x                                   | v1.20           | -               |
| v0.3.x                                   | v1.20           | -               |

### Examples

Some examples are available [here](./examples/kubernetes).

### Installation

These steps will cover how to install the Scaleway CSI driver in your Kubernetes
cluster, using Helm.

#### Requirements

- A Kubernetes cluster running on Scaleway instances (v1.20+)
- Scaleway Project or Organization ID, Access and Secret key
- Helm v3

#### Deployment

1. Add the Scaleway Helm repository.

    ```bash
    helm repo add scaleway https://helm.scw.cloud/
    helm repo update
    ```

2. Deploy the latest release of the `scaleway-csi` Helm chart.

    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install scaleway-csi --namespace kube-system scaleway/scaleway-csi \
        --set controller.scaleway.env.SCW_DEFAULT_ZONE=fr-par-1 \
        --set controller.scaleway.env.SCW_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 \
        --set controller.scaleway.env.SCW_ACCESS_KEY=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST \
        --set controller.scaleway.env.SCW_SECRET_KEY=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
    ```

    Review the [configuration values](https://github.com/scaleway/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/scaleway-csi/values.yaml)
    for the Helm chart.

3. You can now verify that the driver is running:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl get pods -n kube-system
    [...]
    scaleway-csi-controller-76897b577d-b4dgw   8/8     Running   0          3m
    scaleway-csi-node-hvkfw                    3/3     Running   0          3m
    scaleway-csi-node-jmrz2                    3/3     Running   0          3m
    [...]
    ```

    You should see the scaleway-csi-controller and the scaleway-csi-node pods.
